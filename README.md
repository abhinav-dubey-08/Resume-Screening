# Resume-Screening
This project is a Resume Screening and Job Recommendation System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extracts essential information from resumes, such as name, email, phone number, and skills, and categorizes resumes into relevant profiles based on expertise. Additionally, it provides personalized job recommendations by analyzing the candidate's skills and experience. The system automates the recruitment process, making it efficient for HR professionals and helpful for job seekers. Built with Python and NLP libraries like `spacy` and `nltk`, it simplifies resume parsing and job matching. Future plans include integrating job portals and enhancing skill-matching algorithms for better results.
